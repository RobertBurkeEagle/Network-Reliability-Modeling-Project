# üì° LAN Reliability Modeling Project

**LAN Reliability Modeling Project** is a MATLAB-based exploration of network reliability, where I simulate the number of attempts needed to send messages (composed of K packets) through various network configurations. This project visualizes how single-link, two-series-link, two-parallel-link, compound, and custom compound networks perform under different failure probabilities.

This project offers an educational dive into network engineering concepts, with interactive simulations and detailed graphs using logarithmic y-axes.
