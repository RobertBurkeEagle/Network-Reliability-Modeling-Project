# 📡 LAN Reliability Modeling Project

**LAN Reliability Modeling Project** is a MATLAB-based exploration of network reliability, where I simulate the number of attempts needed to send messages (composed of K packets) through various network configurations. This project visualizes how single-link, two-series-link, two-parallel-link, compound, and custom compound networks perform under different failure probabilities.

This project offers an educational dive into network engineering concepts, with interactive simulations and detailed graphs using logarithmic y-axes.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Simulated Network Topologies** – Analyze single-link, series, parallel, compound, and custom networks in real time.
- 🔍 **Variable Failure Probabilities** – Test K values (1, 5, 15, 50, 100, and 1, 5, 10) with p from 0 to 0.99.
- 📈 **Detailed Graphs** – View calculated (solid lines) vs. simulated (hollow circles) results with logarithmic y-axes.
- ⚙️ **1000 Iterations** – Ensures reliable averages for each simulation.
- 📝 **Educational Focus** – Designed to help learners grasp network reliability through visualization.
